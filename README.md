# React.js-Overtime-Randomizer

While working for a software company that sold a healthcare provider 
compensation calculation tool, we ran into all kinds of colorful
language that was used to describe the overtime rules of a provider's
contract. This is the manifestation of that joke as a slot machine
that randomizes a type of overtime using some of the common language
we encountered. 

To add your own language, update the mechanism, denomination, or threshold
arrays in src/SpinnerMachine.js

Enjoy!
