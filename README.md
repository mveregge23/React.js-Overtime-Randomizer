# React.js-Overtime-Randomizer

While working for a software company that sold a healthcare provider 
compensation calculation tool, we ran into all kinds of colorful
language that was used to describe the overtime rules of a provider's
contract. It became a running joke that our customers were cranking a
slot machine to come up with thist language. This is the manifestation 
of that joke.

To add your own language, update the mechanism, denomination, or threshold
arrays in src/SpinnerMachine.js

Enjoy!
