# React.js-Overtime-Randomizer

While working for a software company that sold a healthcare provider 
compensation calculation tool, we ran into all kinds of colorful
language that was used to describe the overtime rules of a provider's
contract. It became a running joke that our customers were cranking a
slot machine to randomize the names of the overtime language in each 
contract. This is the manifestation of the joke as virtual slot
machine to do exactly that.

Run "npm install" in the folder that this project downloads, then "npm start"
to build it.

To add your own language, update the mechanism, denomination, or threshold
arrays in src/SpinnerMachine.js

Enjoy!
